# Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number (LC#2220)

A bit flip of a number `x` is choosing a bit in the binary representation of `x` and flipping it from either `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`.

For example, for `x = 7`, the binary representation is `111` and we may choose any bit (including any leading zeros not shown) and flip it. We can flip the first bit from the right to get `110`, flip the second bit from the right to get `101`, flip the fifth bit from the right (a leading zero) to get `10111`, etc.
Given two integers start and goal, return the minimum number of bit flips to convert start to goal.

## Solution
- Using LSB
    - Code:
        ```cpp
        int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
            int count = 0;
            while(start || goal) {
                if((start & 1) != (goal & 1))
                    count++;
                start >>= 1;
                goal >>= 1;
            }
            return count;
        }
        ```
    - TC: $O(log(max(start, goal)))$
    - SC: $O(1)$
- Using XOR and set bit count:
    - Code:
        ```cpp
        int minBitFlips(int start, int goal) {
            return __builtin_popcount(start ^ goal);
        }
        ```
    - TC: $O(k)$ where `k` is number of bits that are to be flipped
    - SC: $O(1)$
