# Single Number - I (LC#136)

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Solution
- Using maps (store freq of each element)
- Using sorting (sort the numbers and return the very first element which appears once)
- Using unique elements (store all unique elements in a set, find its sum, multiply by 2, subtract sum of all given elements, return the difference)
- Using XOR
    - Code:
        ```cpp
        int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
            int ans = 0;
            for(int e: nums) {
                ans ^= e;
            } 
            return ans;
        }
        ```
