# Kth Largest Element in an Array (LC#215)

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

## Solution

- Using sorting:
    - Sort the elements, and return element at `n-k`th index.
    - TC: $O(nlogn)$
    - SC: $O(1)$
- Using heap:
    - Store first `k` elements in a min-heap.
    - Then, keep on adding the rest of the elements one by one and deleting the largest of them.
        - We will be removing the smallest element from the list.
        - After `n-k` pops, we would have removed smallest `n-k` elements, hence next element will be `k`th largest element.
    - Code:
        ```cpp
        int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
            priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
            for(int i = 0; i < k; ++i)
                pq.push(nums[i]);
            int n = nums.size();
            for(int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
                pq.push(nums[i]);
                pq.pop();
            }

            return pq.top();
        }
        ```
    - TC: $O(nlogk)$
    - SC: $O(1)$
