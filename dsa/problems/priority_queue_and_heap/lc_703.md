# Kth Largest Element in a Stream (LC#703)

You are part of a university admissions office and need to keep track of the `k`th highest test score from applicants in real-time. This helps to determine cut-off marks for interviews and admissions dynamically as new applicants submit their scores.

You are tasked to implement a class which, for a given integer `k`, maintains a stream of test scores and continuously returns the `k`th highest test score after a new score has been submitted. More specifically, we are looking for the `k`th highest score in the sorted list of all scores.

Implement the `KthLargest` class:
- `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer `k` and the stream of test scores `nums`.
- `int add(int val)` Adds a new test score `val` to the stream and returns the element representing the `k`th largest element in the pool of test scores so far.

## Solution

- Using Min-Heap
    - Code:
        ```cpp
        class KthLargest {
            priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
            int k;
        public:
            KthLargest(int k, vector<int>& nums) {
                int n = nums.size();
                for(int i = 0; i < min(n, k); ++i) {
                    pq.push(nums[i]);
                }
                for(int i = k; i < n; ++i) {
                    pq.push(nums[i]);
                    pq.pop();
                }
                this->k = k;
            }
            
            int add(int val) {
                pq.push(val);
                if(pq.size() > k)
                    pq.pop();
                return pq.top();
            }
        };
        ```

    - SC: $O(n)$
