# Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters (LC#1358)

Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

## Solution
- Brute Force Approach:
    - Find all the subarrays, and count number of subarrays with 3 three characters.
    - TC: $O(n^3)$
    - SC: $O(1)$  
- Slight improvement:
    - Instead of finding all the subarrays, fix `l`, and keep track of 3 characters frequency while expanding `r`. Once achieved just add all the subarrays ahead, as they will also satisfy the condition.
    - TC: $O(n^2)$
    - SC: $O(1)$
- Using sliding window:
    - As 
        - contiguous subarrays are required, 
        - count of subarrays is required
        - Frequency of characters are to be checked.
    - Answer to be added is future subarrays on right from current `l`.
    - Code:
        ```cpp
        int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
            int n = s.length();
            int l = 0, r = 0;
            int count[3] = {0};  // state
            int substringsCount = 0;
            while(r < n) {
                // expand right
                count[s[r] - 'a']++;
                r++;

                // shrink while condition is true.
                // here, we are shrinking while condition is true and not false.
                // and we will keep updating the answer inside the loop itself. 
                while(count[0] > 0 && count[1] > 0 && count[2] > 0) {
                    substringsCount += n - r + 1;
                    count[s[l] - 'a']--;
                    l++;
                }
            }

            return substringsCount;
        }
        ``` 
    - TC: $O(n)$
    - SC: $O(1)$
