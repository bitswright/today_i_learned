# Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards (LC#1423)

There are several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array cardPoints.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly k cards.

Your score is the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array cardPoints and the integer k, return the maximum score you can obtain.

## Solution
- Using fixed-size sliding window:
    - Find minimum score window of size `n-k` and return `allCardSum - minScore`.
    - Code:
        ```cpp
        int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
            int n = cardPoints.size();
            int allCardSum = accumulate(cardPoints.begin(), cardPoints.end(), 0);
            if(k == n)
                return allCardSum;
            int minimumScore = accumulate(cardPoints.begin(), cardPoints.begin() + (n - k), 0);
            int l = 0, r = n - k;
            int currentScore = minimumScore;
            while(r < n) {
                currentScore -= cardPoints[l];
                currentScore += cardPoints[r];
                l++;
                r++;
                minimumScore = min(minimumScore, currentScore);
            }
            return allCardSum - minimumScore;
        }
        ```
    - TC: $O(n)$
    - SC: $O(1)$
- Using two pointers:
    - Accumulate first `k` cards score. Then, keep removing cards from right of these first `k` cards and keep adding cards from the back. Keep track of maximum sum and return.
    - Code:
        ```cpp
        int maxScore(vector<int>& cardPoints, int k) {
            int n = cardPoints.size();
            if(k == n)
                return accumulate(cardPoints.begin(), cardPoints.end(), 0);
            int maximumScore = accumulate(cardPoints.begin(), cardPoints.begin() + k, 0);
            int p1 = k - 1;
            int p2 = n - 1;
            int currentScore = maximumScore;
            while(p1 >= 0) {
                currentScore -= cardPoints[p1];
                currentScore += cardPoints[p2];
                p1--;
                p2--;
                maximumScore = max(maximumScore, currentScore);
            }
            return maximumScore;
        }
        ```
    - TC: $O(k)$
    - SC: $O(1)$
